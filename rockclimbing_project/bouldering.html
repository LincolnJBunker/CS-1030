            What is Bouldering?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Bouldering is a type of rock climbing that is done without ropes or harnesses. Due to this, these routes are a lot shorter, anywhere from
            10 - 20 feet high. Since there are no ropes, climbers rely on crash pads to cushion there falls.
            The routes are often called "problems". They tend to be more difficult and require various different moves or
            techniques depending on the specific route.

            What Gear will you Need?
        </h3>
        <p>
            One of the nice aspects of bouldering is that you don't need a ton of gear to get started. Some of the things that you will for sure 
            need include:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Climbing Shoes
                </li>
                <li>
                    Climbing Chalk
                </li>
                <li>
                    1 - 2 Crash Pads
                </li>
            </ul>
            Thats it! With these three items you can begin to adventure out and start sending your own boulder routes. It is also very popular in a gym setting. In that case, you will
            not need to worry about Crash Pads
