                What is Rock Climbing?
            </h3>
            <p>
                Rock Climbing is as it sounds -- climbing up rocks big and small. There are many different ways and forms of rock climbing, but they all have the same goal -- to climb walls made purely of rock.
                This sport has evolved a lot over the years and continues to evolve. New routes go up daily, and the limits are always being pushed to see who can climb the hardest and coolest routes.
                It is a great way to spend time with friends and family, and also spend time in the beautiful outdoors. Whether it be climbing an alpine route in Grand Teton National Park, or climbing a splitter crack in 
                Soutern Utah, there is a place for everyone to climb no matter what style they prefer.
