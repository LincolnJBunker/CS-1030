            What is Sport Climbing?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Sport Climbing is a style of climbing that uses ropes and harnesses, and also a piece of gear called a quickdraw.
            On a sport route, there are bolts every 5 - 8 feet on the route and then a set of chains at the top. As the climber climbs,
            he or she will clip a quickdraw into the the bolt, and then to the rope. The climber does this until they reach the top where they 
            will create a simple anchor to be lowered down. A belayer watches the climber, feeds slack through there belay device, and catches the 
            climber if they fall
