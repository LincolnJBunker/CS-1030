            What is Trad Climbing?
        </h3>
        <p>
            Trad climbing is similar to sport climbing. However, instead of having bolts in the wall, you have to place
            your own gear, called cams, nuts, or hexes, into the wall yourself. You place them in cracks in the wall. Trad is 
            short for 'Traditional climbing'. It is how all climbing was done when the sport began. An appeal to trad climbing is 
            you are a lot more free to climb whatever you want, and you can climb longer routes too.
